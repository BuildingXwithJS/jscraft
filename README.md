# JsCraft - game that teaches you javascript

## Test missions

- [x] Var mission:
      User is given a variable that he has to change

- [x] Conditional mission:
      There will be a global value that user has to react to

- [ ] Function mission:
      User has to write a function that does something

## TODOs

1. Add mission selection
2. Do small mission code refactor and split code into multiple files
